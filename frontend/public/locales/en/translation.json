      "question": "Can I submit maps that aren't in the list yet?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can submit a golden for a map that isn't in the list yet. In this case you must also provide a link to the map and make sure that the map follows all the rules. But even if it does, we may not add it to the list for certain reasons which we will specify in the page with rejected maps."
    },
    "1": {
      "question": "What difficulty should a map have to make it into the list?",
      "answer": "Generally, it should be a map with at least some obstacles on your way and not too short. This is very much a blurry line, but one can generally see the boundaries by looking at the Rejected List, as well as the easier Standard List maps."
    },
    "2": {
      "question": "What do I do if the map has no golden berry?",
      "answer": "In this case you can use debug console (press ~ to open it and to close it) and type the give_golden command to get a golden berry. Alternatively, you can add a golden berry in Ahorn or Loenn (map editors). Make sure that the golden is close to the spawn and isn't directly in the way so one will need more movement to avoid it than to grab it in a non-golden run."
    },
    "3": {
      "question": "Why are some maps easier than rule requirements?",
      "answer": "Some maps that are not satisfying the difficulty criteria may be added for various reasons, at the discretion of the Modded Golden Team. For example, if a map is less than 2 screens but is a part of a collab with all other maps satisfying the criteria."
    },
    "4": {
      "question": "Are demodash buttons/multiple jump binds allowed?",
      "answer": "Demodash buttons and multiple jump binds are allowed. The same goes for any combination of inputs that can be mapped on the same key/button, but external macros which press multiple inputs on different frames are not allowed."
    },
    "5": {
      "question": "Are pause buffers allowed?",
      "answer": "For pause buffers, you can pause the game but if pause was used too aggressively or distinctly used to frame advance (pause/unpause to progress frame by frame), a note may be put into the cell with the golden clear. A run that abuses pause buffering too much might get rejected."
    },
    "6": {
      "question": "What about spinner stunning?",
      "answer": "Due to its difficulty and lack of golden viability, spinner stunning is allowed (pausing frame perfectly multiple times to keep spinners/lightning unloaded). However, deloading spinners by waiting 118+ hours is not allowed."
    },
    "7": {
      "question": "What is the criteria for getting a full clear?",
      "answer": "Maps can have the following optional collectibles that may or may not be obtained in a golden run: Heart, cassette, red berries, and non-red berries such as moon, dashless, or custom berries. Full clear runs generally require getting all optional collectibles, unless a collectible significantly changes the nature of the run, such as the winged golden strawberry in 1A. In that case, the collectible is considered as a special berry, and runs which collect it will gain the [SB] tag. Examples of some maps that have an optional special berry are: A Christmas Night by JaThePlayer, Starship Ruins from Winter Collab and Into The Jungle chapter 1a. The example when a special berry is required is Rite of the Jungle, the run that doesn't get the berry can't be submitted to the list."
    },
    "8": {
      "question": "Why are some maps ineligible for full clear runs?",
      "answer": "Some maps have collectibles which are not optional, such as strawberries in Hell Gym. For other maps, the collectibles do not add any extra challenge to the run, and therefore collecting them in a full clear run is not considered to be different from a standard run. For example, the moon berry in Path of D-espair or the cassette in Void Side."
    },
    "9": {
      "question": "What is the Top Golden List Rankings?",
      "answer": "The Top Golden List Rankings is a list of the hardest golden strawberry clears, where the minimum requirement to get on the list is to be harder than 'Hell Trio' from vanilla, which are the B-Side golden strawberries of chapters 6, 7, and 8. These are ordered by tier, so each color represents a different tier, and the higher up on the list means the harder it is. Please note that these are all decided subjectively by people with experience on the goldens, so these won't be perfectly accurate, and shouldn't be treated as such. The fewer people with the golden the more possible variance there is, so less popular goldens are more likely to be more inaccurate. It's intended to be our best estimate based on what the people who have done the goldens so far have said, so they're subject to change if and when more people do them. People generally try to base off a few things: their total playtime/experience with the game at the time of the golden, how much time they took on the map individually, and a more subjective analysis of the map's length, difficulty distribution, and gameplay consistency, among other things."
