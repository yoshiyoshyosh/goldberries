    [goldberries.net](https://goldberries.net) is an archive of the community's efforts of playing modded Celeste maps without dying. In contrast to the old Google spreadsheet only listing all challenge completions, goldberries.net provides a proper database, verification queue, web-frontend, API and much more.
